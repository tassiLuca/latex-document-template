# Latex document template

## What?
This is a LaTeX template document, which came about as a result of writing my bachelor's thesis, with CI in place :).

## Why?
Writing Latex documents using a WYSIWYM paradigm helps to focus on the content, devolving the document formatting to Latex and, thus, non-worrying about managing indexes, captions, image arrangement.

However, writing a Latex document needs a non-negligible initial setup time. This template aims to nullify this noise.
